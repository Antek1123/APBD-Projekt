# APDB - PJATK project
Hi! I'm a student at Polsko-Japo≈Ñska Akademia Technik Komputerowych university in Warsaw, and I'd like to present to you my old project for the APBD (Database Applications) course. The main task of this project was to create an application for monitoring stock market conditions of specific companies.

The backend of the application was written in C# using the Dotnet 5.0 framework, while the frontend was developed with Blazor technology. Entity Framework was chosen as the ORM. Microsoft SQL Server was selected as the database server. Below, I present the entity diagram of the database. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
